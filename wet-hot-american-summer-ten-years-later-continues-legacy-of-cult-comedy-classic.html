<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later Continues Legacy of Cult Comedy Classic | TV/Streamin</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“Ten Years Later” gets almost everyone from the original film and first series back for a reunion, a decade after the action of the film. So the show actively sends up the early ‘90s in fashion and pop culture, but eventually gets us back to Camp Firewood, where everyone gets a subplot for the season. Katie (<a href=#>Marguerite Moreau</a>) is finally going to tell Coop (<a href=#>Michael Showalter</a>) how she feels about him. Victor (<a href=#>Ken Marino</a>) is still a hysterical virgin, but the reunion offers him a chance to lose that status. McKinley (<a href=#>Michael Ian Black</a>) and Ben (<a href=#>Adam Scott</a>, replacing <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a> and offering a funny bit in which his new looks are excused through surgery for a deviated septum) are still a couple, and they bring along a baby and a new nanny (<a href=#>Alyssa Milano</a>), allowing for a send-up of the “crazed nanny” craze of films in the early ‘90s like “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.” Beth (<a href=#>Janeane Garofalo</a>) may have to sell the camp; Mitch, the talking can of vegetables (H. Jon Benjamin), is back; Susie (<a href=#>Amy Poehler</a>) has become a famous producer and brings a new actor-boyfriend (<a href=#>Jai Courtney</a>); Presidents Bush and Reagan play major roles—it’s all inspired lunacy.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/597d0f0de9fbc351b20000ca/FIN06_WHAS_S2_KA.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>All comedy is subjective, but that of <a href=#>David Wain</a>, who directed all eight episodes again, feels particularly so. Again, he subscribes to a comedic model that could be considered derivative of the Zucker brothers on films like “Airplane!” in that the jokes-per-minute rate is as high as conceivably possible. Don’t like a joke; wait a few seconds and you’ll get another. And this year allows Wain and company to send-up reunion movies like “<a href=#>The Big Chill</a>” and “St. Elmo’s Fire” alongside their very particular sense of humor. It’s a series that brilliantly slides back and forth between intelligent satire and ridiculous physical comedy—there’s a bit with Showalter dressed as Reagan and Black as Bush that involves defecation that has to be seen to be believed. It is a sense of humor that’s constantly calling attention to itself, almost winking and nudging the viewer with a “Get it?!?!” While that kind of comedy can be grating in the wrong hands, there are so many talented people having so much fun here that it’s hard not to just submit to the ride. Not only are the regulars as funny as ever (Marino is particularly amazing) but familiar faces pop up over and over again, including some characters you thought dead and some new ones played by <a href=#>Melanie Lynskey</a>, <a href=#>Dax Shepard</a>, and, believe it or not, <a href=#>Marlo Thomas</a>.</p><p>It’s this simple really: all eight episodes of “Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later” made me laugh, some as hard as anything on TV this year. For me, literally everything <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> and <a href=#>Chris Pine</a> do in this series is funny, but I’m sure everyone will have their own favorite characters and scenes. Overall, it’s broad, ridiculous, silly humor that isn’t as daring or progressive as some of the best comedies on TV but it works more often than it doesn’t. And I hope enough people agree that we can return to Camp Firewood for “Twenty Years Later” in the future. The spirit of Camp Firewood is alive and well. Who would have guessed?&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZrCdpGK1sMCMmqSeqpmYrq950q6kpp2iYsGmuoyynJqqo2K5osDEq2Scp56ptq%2FBxKxkpZ2XlrC6ec6fZJytnKl6pLvMnpuyZZOhrrS%2FyJw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./national-public-holidays-in-nigeria-2.html><span>←</span><span>National &amp;amp; Public Holidays in Nigeria</span></a>
