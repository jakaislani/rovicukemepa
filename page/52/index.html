The movie's plot is a simple one, to put it mildly. The brothers visit their old orphanage, learn that its future is in jeopardy because of five thousand dollars due in back taxes, and determine to raise the money by getting their old band together and putting on a show. Their odyssey takes them to several sleazy Chicago locations, including a Van Buren flophouse, Maxwell Street, and lower Wacker Drive. They find their old friends in unlikely places, like a restaurant run by Aretha Franklin, a music shop run by Ray Charles, and a gospel church run by James Brown.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Villain movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2020)</h2><time>Jun 8, 2024</time>

The tragic nature of Eddie’s story is enthusiastically foregrounded during the movie’s opening scene, when Sean is stripped and threatened at gunpoint by Roy and his perpetually annoyed heavy Johnny (Tomi May). Sean’s the kind of helpless supporting character who seemingly only exists to make our antihero protagonist look good, so of course he pees on himself while Roy threatens him. Sean also immediately overwhelms Eddie with his problems after he picks his brother up from jail, especially Sean’s drug abuse, and his impossibly high outstanding debt to Roy.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Good luck, Hogwarts Legacy PC players: The games saves are broken on PC for official releas</h2><time>Jun 7, 2024</time>

Windows Tablets In the early days of Windows 8 tablets, users had to decide between ARM based devices running Windows RT or x86 devices running the standard version of Windows 8 that you would get on a desktop computer. At this point it's fairly safe to say that Windows RT was an utter failure and is dead as a platform. Removing support for every piece of legacy software effectively removed the appeal of running Windows, and efficient x86 processors from Intel have closed the battery life gap between ARM and x86 in the tablet form factor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Acting Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle [2023 Update]</h2><time>Jun 4, 2024</time>
