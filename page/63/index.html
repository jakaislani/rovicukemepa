<a href=../../review-advance-wars-12-re-boot-camp-is-an-excellent-remake-nearly-ruined-by-its-meager-multiplayer.html></a>
When Nintendo unveiled Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp a couple of years back, it raised more than a few eyebrows. Sure, I was just as surprised as you were that Intelligent System‚Äôs other turn-based tactics series was finally getting a revival, but I was also glad to see that development was being spearheaded by WayForward. The studio‚Äôs catalog of games goes back three decades, and while their recent titles have always proved popular on Nintendo systems, they‚Äôve yet to collaborate with the Big N on a joint project ‚Äî until now.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ateez 'Zero: Fever Epilogue': Release date, concept and all about 'Kingdom' album</h2><time>May 15, 2024</time>

K-pop groups are immensely dedicated to their concept and storylines since their very first album and Ateez is no exception. Their first two years focused on the ‚ÄòTreasure‚Äô series which chronicled the fight between them, their ‚ÄòHala Hala‚Äô selves and the masked man. We then got the ‚ÄòZero: Fever‚Äô series, which began with the ‚ÄòInception‚Äô era where they reconcile with their other selves and join to fight the masked man. They even incorporated their storyline during their time on ‚ÄòKingdom‚Äô and now we might get to the end with the epilogue album.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Batman movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1989)</h2><time>May 15, 2024</time>
<a href=../../batman-1989.html></a>
‚ÄúBatman‚Äù discards the recent cultural history of the Batman character - the camp 1960s TV series, the in-joke comic books - and returns to the mood of the 1940s, the decade of film noir and fascism.
The movie is set at the present moment, more or less, but looks as if little has happened in architecture or city planning since the classic DC comic books created that architectural style you could call Comic Book Moderne.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/62/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
