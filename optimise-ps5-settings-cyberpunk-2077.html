Firstly, CD Projekt RED has promised a batch of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">free DLC</a> that’s set to launch in 2021 for all players, which is always a noble gesture. Secondly, despite many of the performance issues and awful bugs, some gamers are still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gleaning a lot of enjoyment</a> from Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>While there’s currently no dedicated next-gen version, you can play the title via backwards compatibility on both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And interestingly, it’s here where many are insisting that their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">experience has been far more acceptable</a> than Sony and Microsoft’s original base consoles which released way back in 2013. In other words, thanks to the raw power of the newer hardware, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S can effectively brute-force the game into running much more smoothly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Open_Critic-1338502656931860481-20201214_151436-img1.jpg><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Now, thanks to the kind folks over at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, those of you who’re looking to maximize your experience specifically on PS5 have the right settings that’ll help optimize Cyberpunk 2077, as you can see below:</p><ul><li><strong>Turn Off Any Cinematic Features:</strong> In the settings, players should be able to turn off Motion Blur, Depth of Field, and Film Grain. While it does make the game feel more cinematic in its presentation, turning these off will make the game look much better.</li><li><strong>Turn On Continuous Dialogue Skip:</strong> Head to Settings>Gameplay>Miscellaneous>Skipping Dialogue. There is so much dialogue in the game that players will vastly want moments to just skip it all and jump back into the game.</li><li><strong>Disable Damage Numbers:</strong> Similar to titles like&nbsp;Destiny 2 and&nbsp;Genshin Impact, players can turn off individual numbers of damage they are doing. Head to Settings>Interact>Damage Numbers Mode. It will no longer clutter the screen. Health bars for enemies are present regardless.</li><li><strong>Disable Background Chats:</strong> These are the characters in the background that speak indirectly in the area. As it’s a city, these little dialogue boxes will appear very often. Turn them off to remove clutter with Settings>Sound>Subtitles>Overhead.</li></ul><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=false>So, there you have it. Hopefully these minor tweaks will help eke out the best performance on your PS5 and as a result, your adventure in Night City will be a wee bit smoother.
