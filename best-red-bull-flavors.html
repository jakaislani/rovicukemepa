But, I gotta say, the Coconut Edition is a big improvement on the original. “I think there are certain coconut flavored things that don’t really have coconut flavor, but this does,” Sporked staff writer Jordan Myrick observed. Staff writer Danny Palumbo liked that it took that familiar, saccharine Red Bull taste in a totally different direction: “This is the most successful at masking the Red Bull flavor.” If you don’t really love Red Bull, give this a shot.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best red bull flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_RED_BULL_FLAVORS_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sugar Free</p><strong>Red Bull Zero</strong><p>Red Bull went the Coca-Cola route and decided to release a “zero-sugar” variety along with its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sugarfree</a> diet option (the former was released in 2018, while the latter hit shelves in 2003). Compared to both Sugarfree and original Red Bull, we thought this one had a pleasant cream soda sort of flavor with some citrussy notes too. It also seemed to have a little less carbonation than its forebears, and everyone appreciated that. “I think it’s a good thing,” Danny said. Agreed.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best red bull flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_RED_BULL_FLAVORS_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Fruit Flavor</p><strong>The Green Edition Dragon Fruit</strong><p>I don’t think I’ve ever eaten fresh dragon fruit, but it makes for a really interesting Red Bull flavor. This one is almost savory (our editorial assistant Naajia Shukri thought it tasted sort of tomatoey), which really sets it apart from other fruit flavored versions, like peach and watermelon, which both run pretty sweet. If you want an energy drink that isn’t super cloying like Red Bull can tend to be, give this green guy a shot.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best red bull flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_RED_BULL_FLAVORS_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Tart</p><strong>The Red Edition Watermelon</strong><p>As the team predicted, this one tends more toward the taste of watermelon candy than actual watermelon. But, you know, watermelon candy is good and so is this. If you’re used to regular old Red Bull, which is sweet as hell, then this won’t burn out your taste buds too much. But if you wan’t something fruity that isn’t super cloying, give Dragon Fruit a shot.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best red bull flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_RED_BULL_FLAVORS_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Red Bull</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>$33.98 (24 pack) Amazon</a><p>In my opinion, regular Red Bull makes the list by virtue of having a totally unique taste that’s resonated with people for literal decades. Is it for me? Nope. But sometimes a classic is a classic for a reason. It’s also impressive that you can’t quite put your finger on what Red Bull tastes like (is that medicinal tang the Taurine?). It’s a flavor all its own and people love it.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> The Peach Edition, The Yellow Edition Tropical, The Blue Edition Blueberry, Red Bull Sugar Free</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvsSdZJutnKF6p7jAr6arq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-eva-longoria-married-know-who-is-her-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Is Eva Longoria Married?Know Who isher husband The Talks Today</span></a>
