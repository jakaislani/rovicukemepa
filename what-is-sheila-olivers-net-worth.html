Oliver, born on July 14, 1952, was a prominent American politician who made significant contributions to the state of New Jersey.</strong></p><p>She served as the second lieutenant governor of New Jersey from 2018 until August 1, 2023. As a member of the Democratic Party, Oliver broke barriers by becoming the first Black woman to hold the position and the first woman of color elected to statewide office in New Jersey.</p><p>Her political journey began in the 1990s when she served on the Board of Education of the East Orange School District, eventually rising to become its president. In 2004, she represented the 34th legislative district in the New Jersey General Assembly, where she later served as the speaker of the body from 2010 to 2014. Despite facing challenges, including a bid for the U.S. Senate in the 2013 special election, Oliver’s dedication to public service remained steadfast.</p><p>In the 2017 gubernatorial election, she was chosen as the running mate of Democrat Phil Murphy, and their ticket emerged victorious. On January 16, 2018, she was sworn in as the lieutenant governor of New Jersey, making history as the first black woman to hold the position in the state and the first woman of color to be elected to statewide office.</p><p>Throughout her career, Sheila Oliver demonstrated her commitment to education, economic development, and equal employment opportunities. As the Speaker of the Assembly, she played a pivotal role in supporting Governor Chris Christie’s reforms to public workers’ pensions and benefits, which drew both praise and criticism.</p><p>In addition to her political achievements, Oliver earned degrees in sociology and planning and administration, graduating cum laude from Lincoln University and receiving an M.S. from Columbia University. In recognition of her contributions, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Lincoln University.</p><p>Sheila Oliver’s untimely passing marked a significant loss to the political landscape of New Jersey. Her legacy as a trailblazer and champion for what is right continues to be remembered and honored by politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties. Prior to her death, Oliver was considered a potential candidate to succeed Governor Murphy in the 2025 election, a testament to her impact and influence in the state’s politics.</p><p>On July 28, 2023, Sheila Oliver assumed the role of acting governor while New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy was on vacation in Italy. Unfortunately, on July 31, she suffered a medical event and was hospitalized at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston.</p><p>During her hospitalization, Nicholas Scutari, the New Jersey Senate president, temporarily served as acting governor in her place. Tragically, Sheila Oliver passed away the following day at the age of 71.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Sheila Oliver’s Net Worth?</h2><p>Details about her net worth are not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBuv8eeoKWZXaS5qsLEq6pmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plextor-m5m-256gb-msata-review.html><span>←</span><span>TRIM Performance - Plextor M5M (256GB) mSATA Review</span></a>
