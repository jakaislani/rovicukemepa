<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>The Software: Swype Keyboard - Motorola Droid X: Thoroughly Reviewed</h1></header><section class=post-content><h3>Swype Keyboard</h3><p>It isn’t enabled by default, but comes preloaded. I think it arguably is one of the largest steps forward in virtual keyboard interaction paradigms since the first iPhone’s usable virtual keyboard, perhaps since graffiti in Palm OS. Anyone remember those single stroke gestures? I had them down so pat back in the day I could nearly crank 30-40 WPM.</p><p>Regardless, Swype itself is a different and somewhat mind-bending way of inputting text. Instead of tapping and having the touch-up stroke denote a keypress, Swype works based on continual smooth swipes across the keyboard, with sharp changes in direction and a few other gestures denoting the characters that create a given word. You don’t input the entire word character by character, but swipe over the characters that form the word. Swype does some math behind the scenes, decides what word you likely meant based on those characters you passed, and pops out a word.</p><p>It’s mindbending because you run your finger across the keyboard instead of tapping. It’s even more of a twist because you might have to relearn the QWERTY layout a bit - I felt my mind CPU use go to 100% the first few words I tried. With a few days of practice, I was screaming along. The only side effect is that typing on a normal keyboard now feels odd; the first time I went back to my keyboard I found myself wanting to swype.</p><table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2><tbody readability=2><tr readability=6><td colspan=3 readability=7><p>Left: Default installed keyboards, Middle: Typing "just," Right: Attempting to type "dood"</p></td></tr><tr><td><img alt height=316 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3826/device50swype.png width=190 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td><td><img alt height=316 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3826/device58swype.png width=190 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td><td><img height=316 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3826/device59swwype.png width=190 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Most of it is straightfoward - trace out what characters make up the word - but there are a few other things you need to do for special cases. For words with a character that repeats immediately, like “hello,” you make a circle over the character. For capitalization, swipe off the top of the keyboard and then back down.</p><p>If Swype doesn’t know the word you’re trying to input, or there are multiple possible words that could be formed with the keys you’ve passed over, it’ll pop up a box and prompt you to select which one you meant.</p><p>Of course, you don’t necessarily have to always use the swype gestures on their keyboard - you can tap and press just like a normal keyboard. In fact, for words that swype doesn’t know, this is how you teach it.</p><p>I can understand why Swype is shipped with the X disabled, but it’s such a great and different input method that I’m honestly left wondering why Google doesn’t acquire and license it across the entire platform. Sure, it takes some time to learn, but the Swype tutorial is excellent - I went from no knowledge to swyping away in under 10 minutes. That's much easier than the learning curve graffitti threw at users, for example.</p><p>The stock Android keyboard is completely depressing. In fact, it’s pretty much the one thing left on Android on the platform which makes me wince. The X’s excellent Blur multitouch keyboard and even better swype input methods more than mitigate the mammoth device lacking a hardware keyboard. The sheer size of the screen is what really makes it easy to type.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB5fpVopKisn6e8ra2MnamooZRixW7Ax6ipqK2Xnbm6edGeraKdp5qxcH2Q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quinton-lucas-family.html><span>←</span><span>Quinton Lucas Family: Wife Katherine Carttar &amp;amp; Parents</span></a>
