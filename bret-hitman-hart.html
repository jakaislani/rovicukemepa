After surfacing in WWE as one-half of the Hart Connection tag-team duo, the "Hitman" emerged as a fan favorite en route to becoming a five-time heavyweight champion. Hart joined the rival WCW in the late 1990s following the controversial "Montreal Screwjob," before mending ties with WWE the following decade.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Years and Stampede Wrestling</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bret Sergeant Hart was born on July 2, 1957, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the eighth of 12 children of longtime wrestler and promoter Stu Hart and his wife, Helen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An artistic child, Hart enjoyed drawing cartoons and later went to film school, but the lure of the family business proved irresistible. He began selling programs for Stu's Stampede Wrestling promotion at an early age, and soon joined his brothers for practice in the basement of their 22-room mansion, a space known as "The Dungeon." By high school, the well-trained grappler had emerged as a state and provincial champion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hart became a regular competitor in Stampede Wrestling in the late 1970s and went on to claim a series of individual and tag-team championships.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">WWE Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Stu's sale of Stampede Wrestling to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment in 1984, Hart joined his in-laws Jim "the Anvil" Neidhart and Davey Boy Smith on the roster of the rapidly expanding Connecticut-based promotion.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The Hart Foundation</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hart's initial WWE success came as part of the Hart Foundation, a tag-team partnership with Neidhart under the management of the unrelated Jimmy Hart. Known for their eye-catching pink and black attire, Hart and Neidhart toppled the British Bulldogs – Smith and fellow Stampede alumnus Tom "Dynamite Kid" Billington – for their first tag-team title in 1987, and they later became two-time champions at SummerSlam 1990.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Superstar and Champion</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Making the push as a solo performer, the Hitman won over fans with his cool-as-ice style, marked by the gifting of his trademark sunglasses to kids before matches, and his distinct "Sharpshooter" finishing move. He knocked off Mr. Perfect at SummerSlam 1991 to win the intercontinental championship, awarded to the organization's best technical wrestler and reclaimed the title with a dramatic win over <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/rowdy-roddy-piper data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Rowdy" Roddy Piper' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">"Rowdy" Roddy Piper</a> at WrestleMania VIII the following spring.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After dropping the intercontinental belt to Smith in August 1992, Hart earned a bigger prize that October by defeating Ric Flair in his father's hometown of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for the first of his five WWE heavyweight championships. He cemented his elite standing with wins at the 1993 King of the Ring and 1994 Royal Rumble, before ousting the gargantuan Yokozuna at WrestleMania X.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Celebrated primarily as a "face" – a good guy – for much of his championship days, Hart also enjoyed a noted turn as a "heel" to American audiences in the latter half of the decade.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The 'Montreal Screwjob' and Move to WCW</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Set to jump to World Championship Wrestling in late 1997, Hart clashed with McMahon over the directive to lose his belt to rival <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/shawn-michaels data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shawn Michaels" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shawn Michaels</a>. Believing he had earned the go-ahead to vacate the title following a November 1997 showdown vs. Michaels in Montreal, Hart instead was declared the loser of the match by a submission that never occurred, a moment that went down in wrestling lore as the "Montreal Screwjob."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Still one of the sport's most popular figures, the Hitman became a two-time WCW heavyweight champion and teamed with Bill Goldberg for a tag-team title, but an errant kick to the head from Goldberg aggravated the toll of years of hard knocks, and eventually led to Hart's announced retirement in 2000.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Return to WWE</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After recovering from a debilitating stroke, Hart took steps toward mending ties with WWE by way of his induction into the Hall of Fame in April 2006. He publicly reconciled with Michaels during Monday Night Raw in January 2010, and while his attempt to do the same with McMahon resulted in a violent response, Hart enjoyed his revenge by downing the WWE chief with the Sharpshooter at WrestleMania XXVI.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Siblings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Each of Hart's seven brothers became involved in the wrestling industry, while all four of his sisters married professional wrestlers. The youngest Hart, Owen, also enjoyed a prominent WWE career, thanks in part to his rivalry with his big brother, before he was tragically killed in a botched stunt during a May 1999 event.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Book and TV Appearances</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hart published his autobiography, Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling, in 2007.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On screen, Hart landed the recurring role of Luther Root on the mid-1990s Western Lonesome Dove: The Series, and saw an animated version of himself appear on The Simpsons. He was also the subject of the 1998 documentary Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hart fathered children Jade, Dallas, Alexandra and Blade with his first wife, Julie Smadu. He later had a brief union with Cinzia Rota, before marrying Stephanie Washington in 2010.</p><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1957</li><li>Birth date: July 2, 1957</li><li>Birth City: Calgary</li><li>Birth Country: Canada</li><li>Best Known For: Canadian pro wrestler Bret "Hitman" Hart became a popular WWE champion thanks to his smooth style and technical proficiency.</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=33><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Bret 'Hitman' Hart Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/athletes/bret-hitman-hart</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: June 7, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: May 18, 2021</li></ul><ul data-node-id=38 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>I am the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be.</li><li>I've always said pink is not my favorite color, but it was my lucky color.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYraCcmsGmv46bqZ6sXZ22tbnAp2ShmaKp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./before-the-rains-2008.html><span>←</span><span>Before the Rains movie review (2008)</span></a>
