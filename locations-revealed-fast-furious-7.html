It’s difficult to not feel sorry for poor Fast & Furious 6, not even born yet but already in the shadow of its more anticipated younger brother. It’s how a twin must feel just before its twin is born, a twin that is also a good-looking genius.</p><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>The series has burned rubber across myriad countries and territories including Tokyo, Brazil, London, and LA, but that just isn’t enough for Vin Diesel.

Could that mean a returning antagonist? We already know that there’s a post-credits scene for Fast & Furious 6, which sets up the premise for Fast & Furious 7. <strong></strong><strong></strong>This, combined with the fact that Fast & Furious 7 is the start of a <a href=#>whole new trilogy</a>, means that we are unlikely to see the end of this enduring series any time soon. If people buy tickets, the films will keep on coming. It’s just economics. That they’ve got this many films out of such a simple formula is admirable.</p><p data-characters=49 data-current-count=49 data-injectable=false><strong>Fast & Furious 7 </strong>is released July 11th, 2014<strong></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoo6ibkam2sLrSZqmerpWWuaawjJ%2BYrKxdm8Kztc6uqmZvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-scents-repel-bed-bugs.html><span>←</span><span>What scents repel bed bugs?</span></a>
