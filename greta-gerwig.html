At the Oscars, the writing awards are split by original and adapted screenplays, with Anatomy of a Fall competing in the former and Barbie in the latter. Instead, Gerwig and Baumbach face Jonathan Glazer’s The Zone of Interest, Cord Jefferson’s American Fiction, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/christopher-nolan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christopher Nolan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Christopher Nolan</a>’s Oppenheimer, and Tony McNamara’s Poor Things.

She began her career primarily focused up on acting, particularly in independent films, and earned a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in Frances Ha. Her solo directorial debut, 2017’s Lady Bird, saw rave reviews and led to her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/academy-awards data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Academy Award" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Academy Award</a> nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. After earning praise for her movie adaptation of Little Women, Gerwig achieved her greatest box-office success with Barbie, 2023’s highest-grossing movie that also set a new earning record among women-directed movies. Gerwig regularly collaborates with her husband and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Greta Celeste Gerwig<br>BORN: August 4, 1983<br>BIRTHPLACE: Sacramento, California<br>SPOUSE: Noah Baumbach (2023-present)<br>CHILDREN: Harold and another son<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Leo<br></p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Greta Celeste Gerwig was born on August 4, 1983, in Sacramento, California. Her father, Gordon, worked for a credit union, and her mother, Christine, was a nurse. In her youth, Gerwig studied ballet, but she quit in part because she was considered too tall (she is now 5-foot-9). Her mother arranged for her to study other forms of dance, including jazz, tap, modern, and hip-hop.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gerwig was also a competitive fencer, ranking third in the state of California at one point. Although raised Unitarian Universalist, she attended an all-girls Catholic high school, in part, because it offered her the flexibility she needed to attend tournaments. The high costs led to Gerwig dropping the sport, but she still <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpI-AyFMVWI" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fences occasionally" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">fences occasionally</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In high school, Gerwig was involved in theater, an interest she also pursued in college. She attended Barnard College at Columbia University in New York City, where she studied English and philosophy before graduating in 2006. Her college roommate was future Saturday Night Live cast member <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/kate-mckinnon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kate McKinnon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kate McKinnon</a>. The two performed in an improv group together and made “really wonderfully strange musicals” together. Gerwig also wrote and acted in plays.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 title="Movies Greta Gerwig Has Acted In" data-anchor-id=movies-greta-gerwig-has-acted-in class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movies Greta Gerwig Has Acted In</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gerwig sought to become a playwright but after getting rejected from MFA programs in playwriting, she instead focused primarily on acting. She made her film debut while still in college, with a small part in Joe Swanberg’s LOL (2006). This marked her first foray into the “mumblecore” subgenre, notable for its micro-budget films in naturalistic settings with improvised dialogue and shaky cameras. She took bigger parts in mumblecore films like Baghead (2008) and Yeast (2008) and both starred in and co-wrote the films Hannah Takes the Stairs (2007) and Nights and Weekends (2008), the latter of which she also co-directed with Joe Swanberg.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Given the pay scale of these films, Gerwig had to work multiple jobs, including as a tutor and nanny, to make ends meet. But she reached the next level of her career when director Noah Baumbach cast her in Greenberg (2010), which starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-stiller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Stiller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Stiller</a>. This was the first in a number of future collaborations between Gerwig and Baumbach, who later married.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, she co-starred in a remake of Arthur alongside Russell Brand and had a role in No Strings Attached, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ashton-kutcher data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ashton Kutcher" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ashton Kutcher</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/natalie-portman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natalie Portman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Natalie Portman</a>.

I didn’t “help” to write it.’ It used to make my blood rise.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although Gerwig didn’t become an A-list actor, she remained busy. In 2014, Gerwig landed the starring role in the CBS pilot How I Met Your Dad, from the creators of the popular series How I Met Your Mother. However, the pilot wasn’t picked up. That year, she was also in The Humbling with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/al-pacino data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Al Pacino" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Al Pacino</a>. Gerwig was particularly busy leading up to 2016 when she took on roles in Rebecca Miller’s Maggie’s Plan, Jackie about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a>, and 20th Century Women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gerwig hasn’t given up acting but intends to focus on writing and directing. At the Women in Entertainment Summit in 2017, she noted, “I want to produce women’s films, because I think women want to see films made by people who know what they’re talking about, what the experience is.”</p><h2 data-node-id=28 title="Movies Greta Gerwig Has Directed: Barbie, Little Women, and Lady Bird" data-anchor-id=movies-greta-gerwig-has-directed-barbie-little-women-and-lady-bird class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movies Greta Gerwig Has Directed: Barbie, Little Women, and Lady Bird</h2><p id="Directorial-Breakthrough-with-'Lady-Bird'" data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To date, Gerwig has directed three movies: Lady Bird (2017), Little Women (2019), and Barbie (2023).

The movie not only relates a coming-of-age tale with a female protagonist (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/saoirse-ronan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saoirse Ronan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Saoirse Ronan</a>), it also showcases the love between a daughter and her mother (played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/laurie-metcalf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Laurie Metcalf" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Laurie Metcalf</a>) instead of focusing on the protagonist’s romantic pairings. The working title was Mothers and Daughters.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lady Bird was lauded when it premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in September 2017. According to Rotten Tomatoes, it was given 196 positive reviews in a row (the first negative one arrived that December), making it the record-holder for the most “fresh” reviews. The movie went on to earn a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, before garnering five Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">There are parallels between the lives of Gerwig and Lady Bird: Both grew up in Sacramento and attended an all-girls Catholic high school, and both sets of their parents had similar careers. However, Gerwig draws a line between herself and her character. As she explained in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://wtop.com/entertainment/2017/11/qa-greta-gerwig-talks-lady-bird-a-modern-coming-of-age-masterpiece/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an interview with WTOP radio" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">an interview with WTOP radio</a>: “I was nothing like Lady Bird. I never made anyone call me by a different name. I was very much more of a rule follower and gold-star getter. But the core of the movie, the sort of deep, complicated love of a family and a hometown, that’s all really close to my heart.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even though Lady Bird became a success, creating it wasn’t always a straightforward process. It took Gerwig years to write the script, which reached 350 pages at one point. She finished it in 2015 but then faced speed bumps in getting financing for the film. The mother-daughter relationship is important, and one Gerwig felt had been relatively unexplored in cinema, but male financiers who didn’t have sisters or daughters sometimes didn’t understand the relationship dynamics. Gerwig was also so committed to getting the rights to songs like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/justin-timberlake data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Justin Timberlake" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Justin Timberlake</a>’s “Cry Me a River” and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dave-matthews data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dave Matthews" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dave Matthews</a> Band’s “Crash Into Me” that she wrote the songwriters letters explaining what their music had meant to her while growing up.</p><h2 id="'Little-Women'-and-'Barbie'" data-node-id=36 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Little Women</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gerwig’s follow-up writing-directing project, an adaptation of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/louisa-may-alcott data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Louisa May Alcott" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Louisa May Alcott</a>’s 19th century masterpiece Little Women, also wowed critics upon its arrival in December 2019.
