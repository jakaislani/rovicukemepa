'<h2>Can I bring a rock back from Hawaii?</h2>HAWAII (CBS) – Tourism officials in Hawaii are reminding visitors not to take lava rocks home with them. Taking things from National Parks is against the law, so taking volcanic rocks from Hawaii's volcanoes is illegal. But apart from being illegal, legend has it that taking volcanic rocks from Hawaii is bad luck.<h2>Can you take small rocks from Hawaii?</h2>Can You Take Rocks from Hawaii? Just like with seashells, taking rocks from Hawaii in small amounts for your personal use is permitted by the Division of Land and Natural Resources. But again, you're not allowed to sell any of the rocks that you've collected from Hawaii.<h2>What rock can you not take from Hawaii?</h2>For most people, lava rocks are the perfect souvenir. But you should think twice before taking anything from the Island. Legend has it that Pele, the goddess of fire and volcano, enacts a curse on anyone who steals items off the Island.<h2>Tourist Takes Rocks from Hawaii, Doesn't Expect What Happens Next</h2><p></p><h2>Can I take shells from Hawaii?</h2>Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources allows you to collect seashells for personal use but not for resale. You can search for shells year-round, but to beat the crowds, it is better to start searching early in the day.<h2>Can I take rocks from the beach in Hawaii?</h2>It is against federal law to remove rocks from a national park, and against state law to take sand from any Hawaii beach.<h2>Is it OK to take dead coral from Hawaii?</h2>No. In Hawai'i, it is unlawful to take, break or damage, any stony coral, including any reef or mushroom coral (HAR 13-95-70), except as otherwise authorized by law by a Special Activity Permit for scientific, educational, management, or propagation purposes (HRS 187A-6). Am I allowed to collect coral to sell? No.<h2>What is illegal to take from Hawaii?</h2>And that's a very risky endeavor, as taking sand from any beach in Hawaii is punishable by fines upwards of $100,000.

This issue stretches far beyond the beaches of Italy and Hawaii.<h2>What can you not bring back from Hawaii?</h2><p>Common Items from Hawaii NOT ALLOWED into the U.S. Mainland or Alaska</p><ul><li>Fresh fruits and vegetables, some exceptions are those listed below as permitted.</li><li>Berries of any kind, including fresh coffee berries and sea grapes.</li><li>Cactus plants or cactus plant parts.</li><li>Cotton and cotton bolls.</li><li>Fresh flowers of jade vine, and Mauna Loa.</li></ul><h2>Is Pele's curse real?</h2>According to a park ranger at the Kilauea Visitor Center, the “curse” has no basis in Hawaiian culture. The claim is traced back to early tour guides and park rangers who wanted to discourage visitors from removing rocks. Some say it is the power of suggestion.<h2>Why you shouldn't take rocks from the beach?</h2>Tyson Butzke, a California State Parks ranger, cited the California Code of Regulations, which bans gathering of any items, even shells, from beaches. Removing a rock is even worse. It is considered “tampering with geological features.”<h2>Is taking lava rocks illegal?</h2>It's also illegal to take rocks and minerals from any national park. Taking such things as black sand and lava rock depletes a geological resource -- another reason to leave the rocks undisturbed.<h2>Why don't you whistle at night in Hawaii?</h2>According to Hawaiian legends, some say these restless souls are looking for a way to reclaim their rightful territory or searching for a way to enter the new world. It has been said that if you whistle at night, you are summoning the Hukai'po, aka the Night Marchers, and if you hear their drums—HIDE!<h2>Is it illegal to bring sand back from Hawaii?</h2>It is illegal to take sand from Hawaii beaches, state Department of Land and Natural Resources spokeswoman Deborah Ward said. The law contains a limited number of exceptions that do not include personal or commercial sales. Fines for illegally collecting Hawaii sand can reach upward of $100,000.<h2>Can you bring black sand home from Hawaii?</h2>Not to burst the bubble, but it's actually against the law in Hawaii to take black sand home.

You shouldn't eat other people.</p><h2>Why is it illegal to put coins in your ears in Hawaii?</h2>In Hawaii, coins are not allowed to be placed in one's ears.<p>The reason for this is because in 1900 when Hawaii became apart of the United States, there was an order to destroy all Hawaiian coins, and people would hide them in their ears; now it is a sign of being a drug dealer."</p><h2>Is taking sand from Hawaii beaches illegal?</h2>In Hawaii, taking sand has been prohibited since 2013, when the Hawaii State Legislature put the law in effect. This was predominantly in response to tourists taking large quantities of sand from their black sand beaches, like Punaluʻu Beach.<h2>Can you take rocks and shells from Hawaii?</h2>According to the Division of Land and Natural Resources, taking small amounts of sand, dead coral, rocks or other marine deposits for personal, noncommercial use is allowed. However, Hawaii plays host to over seven MILLION visitors per year.<h2>Can I take my lei home from Hawaii?</h2>Those flower lei from your friend's Hawaii wedding? You can take them home… usually. Be sure to ask the lei maker there are any citrus plant parts incorporated in the lei.<h2>Can you keep coral found on the beach?</h2>Eventually, the dead creature will get broken down into thousands of pieces that are going to 'become' the beach. With that being said, if there is no law in the area that makes collecting dead corals illegal, you can totally take one or a few as a souvenir.<h2>How do I return black sand to Hawaii?</h2>Here are some addresses for you to mail your items back to:<p>Sand from Hawaii state beaches can be sent to: Division of State Parks, P.O. Box 621, Honolulu, HI 96809. They will try to return it to the island of origin if you let them know where you got the sand.</p><h2>Can you bring dead coral on a plane?</h2>Live corals in water and a clear transparent container are allowed after inspection by the TSA officer.<h2>Why are there no shells in Hawaii?</h2>Re: Sea shells in Oahu? Two of the main reasons you won't find seashells on the beach here in Hawaii are: the isolation of the islands and the slope of the beaches. If one is diving or snorkeling far off shore, you will see seashells. These of course are homes to living animals and shouldn't be taken.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmJa9sbHNrGSinl2uvLZ505qinmWipLCsv4yfqailXZ2uuK3Iog%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-the-american-flag-with-a-blue-stripe-mean.html><span>←</span><span>What does the American flag with a blue stripe mean?</span></a>
