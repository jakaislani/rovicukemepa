Seen all over the sidewalks surrounding New York Fashion Week, these hair accessories constantly prove their versatility. They can be glammed up or styled down, and worn by people of all hair types — so long as you opt for the right clips, that is.

To do so, we chatted with a few celebrity hairstylists about what makes a great hair clip for thick hair, and researched the top-selling, most highly-rated clips the Internet has to offer. All in all, we found 10 hair clips that will support thick strands while elevating their style. Of these, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clips</a> on Amazon are our top pick.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the full list of the 10 best hair clips for thick hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-tocess-big-hair-claw-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tocess Big Hair Claw Clips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p_N6CqC3Zjv37sykw22ThkgjtPA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tocess-big-hair-claw-clips-8f217029d9744d3abf227376765e6bd0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">TOCESS Big Hair Claw Clips, which are 4.33 inches long, are sold in sets of four. There are 18 color combos to choose from, with 10 sets sold in a single color, and eight in a variety of colors. While most of the clips are available in a matte finish, there are five electroplated metallic sets for those that prefer a high-shine hair accessory. Enough of the aesthetic factor, though — what’s really impressive about these clips is that they’re scratch- and chip-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about them breaking down the way many other clips do. They’re also designed with long, thick hair in mind: Each clip has 18 claws to firmly grip hair without creating excess tension. It’s truly no wonder they’ve accumulated over 21,000 five-star reviews on Amazon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>18 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Long hair of all textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-claw-clip-teleties-large-hair-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Claw Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Teleties Large Hair Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Teleties Large Hair Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mvkEWXAaBC_SBUPBRZLzW23kN94=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TeletiesLargeHairClip1-5805c2360ded4897b71ed137522980fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Teleties might be best known for their spiral hair ties, but the brand’s new claw clips are something to marvel at. The 4.5-inch Teleties Large Hair Clip is unique in that it’s made of lightweight, flexible plastic that’s molded into angled, tapered claws to expertly hold thick hair in place for a comfortable, slip-proof ‘do. As of right now, the new clips are sold in eight colors, though most of them are neutral and/or pastel, so we hope they decide to expand the line to include a few brighter hues (like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbiecore pink</a>!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Flexible Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All hair lengths and textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jumbo-claw-clip-framar-large-claw-clips-for-thick-hair></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jumbo Claw Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Framar Large Claw Clips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Framar Large Claw Clips for Thick Hair" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fd8Jbx3nIgavxGLhvsHZoM_1eyE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FramarLargeClawClipsforThickHair1-bf295405e3bb4de482c3bbeed88ee34f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Very similar to the TOCESS claw clips, Framar Large Claw Clips for Thick Hair feature a cylindrical shape, albeit a touch longer. Thanks to their length, hairstylist, colorist, and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mela & Kera</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Jason Lee</a>, says that the 4.5-inch claw clips are the be-all, end-all for long, thick hair. “This clip is made with a rubbery matte finish, which is super important because it will hold the hair better than a claw clip made of a shinier plastic, which is what we see more regularly,” he explains. “The teeth are also great because they can really get into the hair.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Long hair of all textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mini-claw-clip-anthropologie-speckled-mini-hair-clip-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mini Claw Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Mini Hair Clip Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Speckled Mini Hair Clip Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fmlHWoeW5d9Qwtv7xIu_-MvmbME=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/AnthropologieSpeckledMiniHairClipSet-90c54645f33043a0906c4892a62acee5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to clip back your face-framing layers, the Speckled Mini Hair Clips from Anthropologie are your best bet. Sold in sets of six, the mini claw clips measure one inch long and feature claws that can easily support thick hair, whether it’s straight or curly. Beyond their effective design, these clips have one of the best color and pattern selections of all the options we researched. The sets are sold in seven colors, often with three pairs of varying colors in each. (Though, some sets feature six different clips.) Where the Cream set is a classic, with various duos of glossy tortoiseshell claws, the Slate set is comprised of six different complementary clips (which, thanks to their colors, are especially stunning for fall).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Acrylic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All hair textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-claw-clip-for-curly-hair-pattern-by-tracee-ellis-ross-hair-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Claw Clip for Curly Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jdQ_Ge94FILZqVdIwlF8dJXGVXM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PatternbyTraceeEllisRossHairClip-f8cfd321e5f34804ab5129a9cbe70a7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have super curly hair, a spacious clip that gives your coils room to breathe while still styling them is ideal. According to celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sunnie Brook</a>, the very best claw clip for curly hair is the Pattern by Tracee Ellis Ross Hair Clip, which has 15 long, thin teeth. “It’s extra wide with a super strong spring, and it’s amazing for curly, full-bodied hair,” she explains. While it looks like a mini sculpture for your hair, we do wish it came in more colors so we could wear it for different occasions.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Acetate<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Curly hair of all lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-alligator-clip-framar-gator-grip-clips></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Alligator Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Framar Gator Grip Clips</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Framar Gator Grip Clips" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kIHMjTsybxLpewSMZ1rxbNW1Il8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FramarGatorGripClips1-fe656f270cbe4a7faefebeb13e0e5071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest challenges for folks with thick hair is styling it. After all, with such heavy strands, they can take forever to blowdry, straighten, and curl. The easiest way to speed up the process is to section your hair with alligator clips, which are designed not to leave kinks. According to celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">NTRL by Sabs</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Sabrina Rowe Holdsworth</a>, Framar Gator Grip Clips go above and beyond. “They are really sturdy, so they really hold the hair in place — and come in matte black,” she says, admitting that she personally loves them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Plastic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All hair textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-barrette-mistofu-classic-large-snap-barrettes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Barrette</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mistofu Large Snap Barrettes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mistofu Classic Large Snap Barrettes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Pb20KRuKNdydmKu_zVnsrJDjTWg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MistofuClassicLargeSnapBarrettes1-c1f5dc6ab7af46eeb608446e725e1083.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>They’re sold in 14 color palettes, each of which features three different clips, so there are plenty of options.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Oversized barrettes are incredible to keep thick hair half up, just make sure the base of the barrette is extra-large as the [smaller ones] will not stay with thick hair,” says celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sarah Potempa</a>, who is the creator of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">The Beachwaver Co</a>. With this in mind, the Mistofu Classic Large Snap Barrettes, which are sold in sets of three, top the category thanks to their 4.13-inch length, which includes 3.14-inch metal clips to hold ample hair. The best part about these barrettes is that, while they're sold in a classic rectangular shape, they’re also available in trendy wavy, braided, and butterfly-shaped silhouettes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>14 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Acrylic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Hair of all textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-snap-clip-kitsch-xl-snap-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Snap Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kitsch XL Snap Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kitsch XL Snap Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zUGcrFXAleN6FjdhZv49BPjKxCY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/KitschXLSnapClip-16de49b0fc6240678e4c8ec12fa770ad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Prefer snap barrettes as your ‘90s hair clip of choice? If you have thick hair, Lee says you’ll want to opt for a large clip designed to hold more hair. With that in mind, he recommends the Kitsch XL Snap Clips, which have earned over 1,700 five star Amazon reviews. Sold in sets of two, the clips are 3.5 inches long and designed specifically with thick hair in mind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And let it be known: There are many ways to style snap clips. “Whether it’s growing out your blunt bang or securing those layers into your pony, snap clips are not only for hiding layers,” Potempa says. “These can be incorporated into a half up style or a chic top knot as a fun way to accessorize your look to match your outfit.” And, if you prefer smaller snap clips to these larger ones, Potempa assures us that using multiple can be both functional and cool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Metal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Long hair of all textures</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bobby-pin-goody-slideproof-bobby-pins></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bobby Pin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R-Sq4AE_bw-Nn3K6F_2P1yfQyok=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GoodySlideproofBobbyPins1-d5d3a72a13b14de2aa5ac3650116c559.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>They’re ho-hum style-wise, so they’re designed to be concealed, not boldly styled to stand out.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bobby pins are sold in various lengths but, according to Potempa, when it comes to thick hair, two-inch bobby pins are best. “Traditional one-inch bobby pins just will not hold and you’ll need double the amount,” she says. As such, Goody Slideproof Bobby Pins, which are two inches long and sold in two colors, not to mention packs of 48, are a no-brainer for thick hair. (Just ask the more than 12,000 Amazon shoppers who have given them their five-star seal of approval.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pro Tip: When using bobby pins, Lee says to make sure you’re inserting them correctly. “Most people think that bobby pins are supposed to go smooth side in, when in fact, it's the ridged side that needs to go inwards to hold the hair in place,” he says. “The smooth side will always slip out.” Another tip? Spritz the pin with hairspray before sticking it in. “Place it in when it's still a little wet and that will help hold thicker hair, as you need as much grip as possible,” Lee says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Materials: </strong>Metal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Hair of all textures and lengths</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-clip-emi-jay-big-effing-clip></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge Clip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Emi Jay Big Clip</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Emi Jay Big Effing Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9B6ZsSbqkMcq4o5cnFrnPvXh_ls=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Emi-Jay-Big-Effing-Clip-d6dbd5f787084db88da5221d6d5d5285.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Emi Jay</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Since the clips have thicker, closer-together claws, they’re not as accommodating for ultra-thick curly hair.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Emi Jay is the name behind arguably the most head-turning hair clips on the market.

It’s easier than you think, though — at least if you opt for the classic use. “For my clients that have thick hair that easily slips, I suggest pulling hair into a ponytail and then twisting it up and securing with a claw,” Brook says. “This will keep the hair pulled together and provide added support since heavy hair can tend to sag or slip.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you can simply twist your hair up or down and clip it into place, there’s also the option to check out the many claw clip hacks on Instagram and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>TikTok</a> (which have gotten upwards of 25 million views).

While he recommends using <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Mela & Kera Balayage Exceptionnel Wave Foundation</a> to give the hair extra grip, Brook says that using your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>favorite dry shampoo</a> can work wonders.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What size claw clip works best with thick hair?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember: The bigger the better. “For thicker hair, I recommend using claw clips that range between four and five inches,” Lee says. “These clips will hold thicker hair, and typically anything smaller might be too small.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Brook says to pay special mind to the teeth and spring, too. “Look for claw clips that have large, rounded interlocking teeth and a strong spring,” she says. “I like to use a medium- to large-size claw clip or two half-size ones.
