The film is set in Tel Aviv, but it's not an "Israeli film." That's where it was made, but it's not about anything particularly Israeli. It could take place in countless cities, and it's not "about" anything at all, in the way of a message, a theme or a revelation. What it offers is a portrait of some time in these lives, created with attentive performances and an intriguing way of allowing them to emerge a little at a time.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Samsung 970 EVO Plus (250GB, 1TB) NVMe SSD Review: 92-Layer 3D NAND</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../the-samsung-970-evo-plus-ssd-review.html></a>
The first retail consumer SSDs to be updated with new 96-layer 3D NAND flash memory are the&nbsp;Samsung 970 EVO Plus. The 970 EVO Plus will be replacing the 970 EVO as Samsung's mainstream consumer NVMe SSD. Today we are reviewing two of the launch drives: the 970 EVO Plus at 250GB, and the 970 EVO Plus at 1TB. These two drives are Samsung's attack on both the mainstream and high capacity markets, while the new NAND has a focus more on power than driving&nbsp;down overall costs per GB.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vincent Regan Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../what-to-eat-with-cottage-cheese.html></a>
You don’t have to live in a quaint, thatched-roof cabin in the English countryside to enjoy cottage cheese—you just have to come up with something good to eat it with. This clumpy, loose cheese may be polarizing (some people just can’t handle curds!), but it’s delicious, especially if you buy the best. If you’re a fan, you’ve probably had it with pineapple tidbits or a nice halved cantaloupe, but there’s a world of options out there.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>AWS WAF rule AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet does not seem to work properly</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>

I'm currently trying to setup a Cloudfront distribution with a web ACL (WAF). I enabled the AWS managed rule called AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet (documentation to this rule can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html).
I'm testing a Remote File Inclusion, for which I would expect my query to be blocked by the WAF. Unfortunately, my request still goes through.

<a href=../../../../darth-vader-shows-his-mastery-of-the-force-in-this-weeks-obi-wan-kenobi.html></a>
Darth Vader is a scary dude. In the original trilogy he’s the embodiment of the Emperor’s will, with nobody able to match him in battle. Every other appearance has depicted him as someone you flee from rather than fight, perhaps best exemplified by him cleaning house in that unforgettable scene during the Rogue One finale. Well, this week’s Obi-Wan Kenobi once again showed Vader at the height of his powers, demonstrating his terrifying mastery of the dark side of the Force.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Much Is The Net Worth Of Scarlett Estevez? age, height, parents, Lucifer</h2><time>Aug 23, 2024</time>
