If you're wondering how North Korea (population 25 million) can raise enough invaders to attack the Unites States (population 315 million), it may help to understand that the original screenplay for this remake named the invaders as Chinese. After principal photography was completed on this film three years ago and its studio (MGM) went belly-up, the enemy identity was changed to North Korea by reshooting several scenes, redubbing lots of dialogue and using digital adjustment to change the looks of flags, uniforms and insignia on trucks and tanks.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Adore Delano: Boyfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</h2><time>May 14, 2024</time>

I remember the sickness was forever
I remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers, the distances we covered
The fistfightson the beach
TheBizzies round us up
Do it allagain next week
An embryonic love
The first time that it scarred
Embarrassyourselfforsomeone
Cryin’ like achild
And the boywho kicked Tom’s head in
Still bugs me now
That’s the thing, it lingers
And claws you when you’re down

The multitalented Lin-Manuel Miranda provides the songs and the voice of the titular role: a charismatic and wide-eyed kinkajou who busks on the streets of Havana. Most of the movie’s music carries the catchy rhythms and clever wordplay that are the signatures of the man who created “Hamilton” and “In the Heights.” An infectious highlight is the upbeat, Latin-flavored opening number, which Vivo performs to an appreciative crowd alongside his human companion, the aging musician Andres (a gentle Juan de Marcos of Buena Vista Social Club).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Is Sam Bankman-Frieds Age?
