Duke was born and raised in Utah’s capital, Salt Lake City, where he started out as a wedding photographer and quickly gained a following through social media.

The 19 year old TikTok star chose Willy Wonka because of his already relatable and similar features to the chocolatier himself. Although most of us know the famous character as the strict factory owner and tour guide, Duke takes his videos to a whole new level bringing Willy Wonka to Generation Z to keep up with the latest dancing trends. While playing this character, he is sure to tie in the classics memories of the character like his famous chewing up, tour guide guests, and the adorable Umpa Lumpa’s.&nbsp;</p><p>Willy Wonka’s followers thrived off of the account from the very beginning. Tiktok contains a wide variety of users, who have provided a mixture of trending content. But what is better than a classic chocolatier coming back?

Duke is able to interact with his fan base periodically through their comments, “dueting” of his videos, and live streaming as Willy Wonka. The viewers have shown their obsession by helping Duke reach hundreds of millions of views. Some have even openly developed a crush on Dukes’ Willy Wonka, while others are seeking <a href=#>entertainment</a> and a trip down memory lane.&nbsp;</p><p>Not many people can pull off the famous <strong><a href=#>Willy Wonka character</a></strong>, but Duke has got it on point. The unique trends and viewer interaction that he brings to the account is what helps him continue making his mark on TikTok, especially his pink wig!
