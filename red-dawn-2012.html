<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Red Dawn movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2012)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>If you're wondering how North Korea (population 25 million) can raise enough invaders to attack the Unites States (population 315 million), it may help to understand that the original screenplay for this remake named the invaders as Chinese. After principal photography was completed on this film three years ago and its studio (MGM) went belly-up, the enemy identity was changed to North Korea by reshooting several scenes, redubbing lots of dialogue and using digital adjustment to change the looks of flags, uniforms and insignia on trucks and tanks. Did this involve a change in ideology in Hollywood? Not really. A marketing genius figured out that China is one of the biggest markets for American movie exports, and North Korea generates unimpressive box-office bucks for Yank product, as the trade papers like to word it.</p><p>But back to football. The home-team Wolverines are headed by star player Matt Eckert (<a href=#>Josh Peck</a>), whose older brother, Jed (<a href=#>Chris Hemsworth</a>), is a Marine just returning from active duty. That's a nifty way to include someone with military training and experience on your side. Jed takes unofficial command as the Wolverines go into action against the invaders. Matt's girlfriend is Erica (<a href=#>Isabel Lucas</a>), a cheerleader, and Toni (<a href=#>Adrianne Palicki</a>) is a spunky hometown girl who develops a crush on Jed.</p><p>The nature of the invasion quickly becomes clear. The North Koreans take over the police department as their headquarters and co-opt the feckless mayor to help them issue pronouncements. His son, Daryl (<a href=#>Connor Cruise</a>), of course joins the Wolverines, who also include <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a> (very good as the son in "<a href=#>The Kids Are All Right</a>"). No mention is made of other Spokane high school teams, so it must be just this one heroic team and its recruits who turn back the invasion.</p><p>The story's time frame is confusingly murky. How long does it take the North Koreans to land, import their heavy weapons and vehicles, enlist local traitors and start running things? What is their game plan? Is this a national invasion? How do they plan petrol deliveries? We're unclear about what's happening in the rest of the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rnJ1llJbEr3mRaWhr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mai-tai-recipe.html><span>←</span><span>Mai Tai Recipe (Classic Cocktail)</span></a>
