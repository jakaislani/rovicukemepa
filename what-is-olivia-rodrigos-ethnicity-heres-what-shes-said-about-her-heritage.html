I’m part Filipina on my dad’s side of the family. My Filipino heritage comes from my great-grandfather. He came on a boat from the Philippines when he was just a teenager. Can you imagine moving to a whole new country all by yourself?”</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>While speaking with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Center For Asian American Media</a> in 2018, Rodrigo spoke about how her family’s Filipino traditions have “trickled down” to her generation and expressed interest in visiting the Philippines.</p><p>“My great-grandfather immigrated here from the Philippines when he was just a teenager. He’s my grandma’s dad, and my grandpa is also Filipino as well. My dad grew up in a house where they were always making Filipino food, his grandpa always spoke Tagalog. All of those traditions have trickled down to our generation. Every Thanksgiving we have lumpia, and things like that. I have never been to the Philippines, but I really, really want to. We still have extended family there, but I’ve never met them. That’s on my bucket list, definitely. When we were doing the Asian and Pacific Islander video, my whole family chipped in. They send me pictures for the video. I learned so much about it through my family. That video totally taught me a lot. It’s so important to know your culture. Talking about it with them was really informative.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Rodrigo (@oliviarodrigo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Last year, in an exclusive interview with Bowen Yang for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">V Magazine</a>, she revealed the heartwarming responses she has received from young girls due to her being Filipina and the importance of Asian-American representation in pop music.&nbsp;</p><p>“I sometimes get DMs from little girls being like, ‘I’ve never seen someone who looked like me in your position.’ And I’m literally going to cry… Like just thinking about it. I feel like I grew up never seeing that. Also, it was always like, ‘Pop star,’ that’s a white girl.”</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>Rodrigo’s success in 2021 was groundbreaking, especially for Asian representation.
