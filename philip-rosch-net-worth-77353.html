In November 1721 Roche and three associates booked passage on a <a href=#>French</a> vessel sailing to Nantes. Roche was charismatic and had knowledge of seafaring, and convinced the ship‚Äôs master to let him handle the vessel. At a signal they rose up, slaughtered the <a href=#>French</a> crew, and threw the captain overboard. They debated where to sail next, including Newfoundland. Afraid of being discovered, they modified the ship‚Äôs appearance, altered the ship‚Äôs logbooks, and renamed it <i>Mary</i> before sailing to Rotterdam to sell its cargo.</p><span>1723</span><p>Roche was eventually found in London and imprisoned in Newgate. Tried for piracy, he was found guilty and hung in August 1723. The public was disappointed at the execution: Roche "was so ill at the time that he could not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for which he suffered."</p><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>18th-century pirates</a> <a href=#>Irish pirates</a> <a href=#>Pirates</a> <a href=#>People executed for piracy</a> <a href=#>1693 births</a> <a href=#>1723 deaths</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmegnbattc9mqairk516r7HTZq6oqqSdeniDkm5q</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-lohans-best-style-moments-since-returning-to-acting-pics.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Lindsay Lohan's Best Style Moments Since Returning to Acting: Pics</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>HugoÔ∏èÔ∏è</a>Ô∏è</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
