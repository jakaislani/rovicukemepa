As of this writing, they are currently sold out, but there will be another opportunity to buy on Wednesday, November 22. Should you set your alarm so you can be one of the first to hit the buy button? Here’s our review of the DiGiorno Thanksgiving pizza.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="digiorno thanksgiving pizza" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NPR_DIGIORNO-THANKSGIVING-PIZZA_INSET.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New DiGiorno Pizza!</p><strong>DiGiorno Thanksgiving Pizza</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>DiGiorno</a><p>Made on DiGiorno’s buttery, puffy Detroit-style crust, the DiGiorno Thanksgiving Pizza comes topped with slices of roast turkey, <a href=#>gravy</a>, diced sweet potatoes, green beans, dried cranberries, fried onions, <a href=#>mozzarella cheese</a>, and cheddar cheese. The verdict? It’s good and you should get it. “I love it,” managing editor <a href=#>Gwynedd Stuart</a> said immediately after taking a bite. But let’s dive in deeper.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Pros: </strong>We were worried that the turkey would be dry, but it’s not! It tastes like real, well-seasoned Thanksgiving turkey slices. The meat gets a little crispy in the oven, but it still stays juicy enough. The gravy is incredible—so, so savory and peppery—and it makes a terrific pizza sauce. We should all be using gravy as pizza sauce. Something else we should be doing? Topping Thanksgiving food in melted cheese. It really, really worked! But the true stars of this Thanksgiving pizza: the crispy fried onions. These are like the crispy onions you get on green bean casserole, and they should be a default option on pizza delivery menus. They’re sweet and crispy and earthy and a delightful addition to ‘za.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Cons: </strong>My main complaint is that there are no<a href=#> mashed potatoes</a>! How can you have a Thanksgiving anything without mashed potatoes? The only potato presence is sweet potato, and that doesn’t count. At least add a few thinly sliced potatoes to the pie for that potato gratin vibe. Also, the cranberries don’t really taste like anything. Nor do the green beans or the sweet potatoes, for that matter. But really, you’re not getting Thanksgiving pizza for the green beans. So we forgive you, DiGiorno.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, DiGiorno has created a gem of a Thanksgiving pizza that should be added to its <a href=#>frozen pizza</a> lineup. Hop online early to secure your own on November 22. But if you miss the window, just make your own. Gravy on pizza forever!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / DiGiorno</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked" title='Play video "Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese SOUP DUMPLINGS?! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgbDU7SGRaE&list=PLHbjKrchTZzsSSNxQfCn9JpW3evHOmxqK</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyZnLawvs2oZK2gkaO4tLPIr6Cnn12ltrvGwGapnq6ZmsRw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toyin-lawani-allegedly-a-2nd-wife-to-segun-after-abandoning-his-first-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Toyin Lawani Allegedly A 2nd Wife To Segun After Abandoning His First Wife</span></a>
