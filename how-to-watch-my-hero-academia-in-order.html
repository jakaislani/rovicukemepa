Like many other seasons, this latest one continued to cement its place as one of today’s most popular and dominant anime series maintaining the <a href=#>number one spot throughout its season</a>. For those who are yet to start their My Hero journey, there has been no better time to do that than now with plenty to sink your teeth into.</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Right now there is no news on when fans can expect season seven of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">but the first details of the franchise’s fourth film have been shared</a>. This is shaping up to be the darkest outing yet, so there’s a lot to look forward to.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>We do know that a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth film in the My Hero Academia series is scheduled to arrive in summer of 2024</a>, but as we haven’t seen any footage from the movie it is unclear where exactly it will take place in the franchise’s timeline.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has also shared news</a> that it will be producing an original live-action show based on the My Hero Academia manga.
