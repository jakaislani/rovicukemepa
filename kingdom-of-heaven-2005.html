<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Kingdom of Heaven movie review (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>That's an insight that helps me understand my own initial question about the film, which was: Why don't they talk more about religion? Weren't the Crusades seen by Christians as a Holy War to gain control of Jerusalem from the Muslims? I wondered if perhaps Scott was evading the issue. But not really: He shows characters more concerned with personal power and advancement than with theological issues.</p><p>Balian, a village blacksmith in France, discovers he is the illegitimate son of Sir Godfrey (<a href=#>Liam Neeson</a>). Godfrey is a knight returning from the Middle East, who paints Jerusalem not in terms of a holy war but in terms of its opportunities for an ambitious young man; it has a healthy economy at a time when medieval Europe is stagnant. "A man who in France has not a house is in the holy land the master of a city," Godfrey promises. "There at the end of the world you are not what you were born but what you have it in yourself to be." He makes Jerusalem sound like a medieval Atlanta, a city too busy to hate.</p><p>For the 100 years leading up to the action, both Christians and Muslims were content to see each other worship in the holy city. It was only when Christian zealots determined to control the Holy Land more rigidly that things went wrong. The movie takes place circa 1184, as the city is ruled by the young King Baldwin (<a href=#>Edward Norton</a>), who has leprosy and conceals his disfigured face behind a silver mask. Balian takes control of the city after the death of its young king. Then the Knights Templar, well known from <i><i>The Da Vinci Code</i></i>, wage war on the Muslims. Saladin (<a href=#>Ghassan Massoud</a>) leads a Muslim army against them, and Balian eventually surrenders the city to him. Much bloodshed and battle are avoided.</p><p>What Scott seems to be suggesting, I think, is that most Christians and Muslims might be able to coexist peacefully if it were not for the extremists on both sides. This may explain why the movie has displeased the very sorts of Muslims and Christians who will take moderation as an affront. Most ordinary moviegoers, I suspect, will not care much about the movie's reasonable politics, and will be absorbed in those staples of all historical epics, battle and romance.</p><p>The romance here is between Balian and Sibylla (<a href=#>Eva Green</a>), sister of King Baldwin. You might wonder how a blacksmith could woo a princess, but reflect that Sir Godfrey was correct, and there are indeed opportunities for an ambitious young man in Jerusalem, especially after his newly discovered father makes him a knight, and Tiberias (<a href=#>Jeremy Irons</a>) enlists him as an aide to Baldwin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46koKeflKS6brvFZp%2Bemaaau25%2Bj2ls</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-petras-2.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Petras Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family, Height and Biography</span></a>
