Hildebrand previously starred opposite Ryan Reynolds in Wade Wilson’s first two cinematic outings, in the role of X-Men member Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Kutsuna, meanwhile, was added into the mix in Deadpool 2 as Yukio, her mutant ninja girlfriend. This on-screen relationship made the pair the very first openly gay superheroes in any Marvel movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/negasonic-teenage-warhead-yukio-deadpool-2-1.png><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>Hildebrand and Kutsuna are just the latest returning cast-members from Fox’s franchise, after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Morena Baccarin (Vanessa)</a>, Karan Soni (Dopinder), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Stefan Kapicic (Colossus), and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Delaney (Peter)</a>.

Meanwhile, fresh additions Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen are likewise on board, probably as villains.
