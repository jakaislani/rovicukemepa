On the day it was set to come out, there is an issue with saving play and the workaround requires what seems like a Master’s degree in computer coding to fix.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Designers have been working on HL since Warner Bros. Games acquired Avalanche Software in 2017. In its five-year history, it has been plagued with issues from release delays to the real-world controversy of the franchise creator, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">J.K. Rowling</a></strong>. One designer — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Troy Leavitt — had to leave the project</a> and reported that it had nothing to do with his support of cultural appropriation or his participation in the Gamergate Harassment Campaign, although the timing of his departure makes it highly suspect.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>With release delay issues and gaps being left when designers leave the project, was the coding of Hogwarts Legacy rushed to the point that an inferior product was offered to the public? The answer to that question lies in the fact that RPGs take so long to set up and play that saving the game is a pretty common feature. If a game doesn’t have that capability, it is in fact inferior.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true><a href=#>PSA: There is a glitch on PC that causes save game progress to disappear.
