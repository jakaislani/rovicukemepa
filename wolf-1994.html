<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Wolf movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1994)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>But "Wolf" is both more and less than a traditional werewolf movie. Less, because it doesn't provide the frankly vulgar thrills and excesses some audience members are going to be hoping for. And more, because Nicholson and his director, <a href=#>Mike Nichols</a>, are halfway serious about exploring what might happen if a New York book editor did become a werewolf.</p><p>Nicholson looks tired and aging in the opening scenes. He's playing Will Randall, a soft-spoken, pipe-smoking literary man of the old school, whose authors are loyal to him. Then a rich investor (<a href=#>Christopher Plummer</a>) buys the firm, and throws a party during which he takes Nicholson out on the lawn to tell him he is being fired. His replacement, a traitor Nicholson thought was his friend, is the polished young hypocrite Stewart Swinton (<a href=#>James Spader</a>, playing what can only be called the James Spader role, and playing it very nicely, too).</p><p>This scenario doesn't develop as office politics as usual, however, because of the strange experience Nicholson had a few nights earlier in Vermont, where he was bitten by a wolf. Soon hair begins to flourish around the wound, and Nicholson sleeps all day but is awake all night, and his wife (<a href=#>Kate Nelligan</a>) is caught in an adulterous affair because Nicholson is able to smell his rival on his wife's clothing. Meanwhile, Laura, the millionaire's daughter (<a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer</a>) becomes Nicholson's confidant. Any enemy of her father's is a friend of hers.</p><p>The tone of the movie is steadfastly smart and literate; even in the midst of his transformation, the Nicholson character is capable of sardonic asides and a certain ironic detachment. He does, however, grow more predatory.</p><p>"I'm going to get you," he promises Spader. And after he urinates on the younger man's shoes, he explains: "I'm marking my territory." All of this is not quite as poignant as it might have been.</p><p>A similar movie, David Cronenberg's "The Fly," starred <a href=#>Jeff Goldblum</a> as a scientist who realizes he is gradually becoming a fly, and <a href=#>Geena Davis</a> as the woman who tries to love him in spite of . . . well, in spite of the fact that he's a fly. There was true emotion there, and dread. Nicholson's character, on the other hand, seems to enjoy becoming a wolf. He begins to look younger and stronger, and although he fears what he may do and sometimes demands to be locked up, there is the sense that being a wolf is not com pletely unacceptable to him. Of course (this is strictly my personal opinion), it is better to be a wolf than a fly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wpqWeXWaGeoA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ronald-isley-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-kids-mr-biggs-brothers-songs-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Ronald Isley Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Kids, Mr Biggs, Brothers, Songs and Net Worth</span></a>
